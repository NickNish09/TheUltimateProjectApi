To contribute, use the gitflow:
Create a new branch from `develop`

Use the pattern `feature/feature_name` or `fix/fix_name` to name your branch

Always keep your branch up to date with rebase:

``` git pull origin develop --rebase ```

``` git push -f ```

Make a pull request to `develop`, following the pull request template
Do a `squash and merge` after the PR is approved, removing the unnecessary commits.
